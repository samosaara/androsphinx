  <h1 class="about" id="about">about me</h1>
  <p>I'm a very passionate junior software developer, who is looking to expand my career and horizons. I'm currently
    employed at IBM Brazil designated to a high profile client in the insurance business, participating in one of the
    leading innovation teams, we bring disruptive innovation to the client with cognitive technology, all done with
    quality, testable and well-documented code.</p>
  <p>I'm also an all-around nerd, gamer, hacker and biker on free time, still on college trying to get the paper tube
    to appease the HR ladies, don't get me wrong, college certainly has a value, I just find it quite frustrating how
    it's somehow necessary, or how it will be able to prove that I'm "<i>able</i>" to exercise the job I've already
    been doing for the last year.</p>
